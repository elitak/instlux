Translations on instlux are mainly based on the following:

Requeriments:

1- NSIS installer is translated
2- There is a GPL license translated

If nsis is not translated, contribute to nsis with them.

At the free software foundation you can find some gpl license translations you can base your translations on.

3- If nsis is translated, and the gpl license, too, then you will need to translate the senteces

Then, copy the license there with the name license_language (being language the name of the folder)
After that, edit the license, add the line "Instlux, Copyright (C) 2005-2006 Jordi Massaguer Pla" at the beginning, followed

"install Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu installer"

then, make a folder into nsis_translated/translations with the name of your language.

Localizing free software is very important for making free software get to as many people as possible. 
It would be great to have instlux translated into more languages!
